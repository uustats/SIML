[["1-ch-likelihood.html", "Chapter 1 Likelihood-based methods", " Chapter 1 Likelihood-based methods This chapter is about methods for statistical inference based on the likelihood function. We start by discussing how we can find a point estimate of a parameter by using the maximum likelihood estimate. Once we have a point estimate we want to know how certain or uncertain this estimate is. This can be done by either simply calculating the standard deviation of the estimate or by calculating a confidence interval or by doing a hypothesis test. We then discuss the likelihood ratio test which is a general way of testing hypothesis based on the likelihood function. However, in many situations the distribution of the likelihood ratio under the null hypothesis is difficult to find, so we turn to asymptotic results. I.e. results that are valid when the sample size is large. It turns out that maximum likelihood estimates in general have an asymptotic normal distribution, with the true parameter value as expected value and variance given by the Fisher information, which can be calculated from the log-likelihood function. Based in this we find three different types of asymptotic hypothesis tests. Finally we will see how this can be applied to the binary regression model.

Let us begin with a simple example. Imagine that we toss a coin with an unknown probability \\(p\\) of landing on heads. Each time the coin lands on heads we record a 1 and each time it lands on tails a 0. We repeat the experiment 10 times and observe the sequence: ## [1] 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 We can calculate the probability of observing this exact sequence. The probability of observing 1 is \\(p\\) and of observing 0 is \\(1-p\\). Since the observations are independent, the total probability will be the product of each probability and so the probability is \\[ p^3(1-p)^7. \\] We can think of this as a function of \\(p\\) that tells us the probability of observing what we actually observed. For example, if \\(p=0.4\\) the probability is \\(1.79 \\cdot 10^{-3}\\), or if \\(p=0.5\\) the probability is \\(9.77 \\cdot 10^{-4}\\). The principle that we will follow to estimate parameters is that since \\(p=0.4\\) gives a higher probability to our observation than \\(p=0.5\\) we will prefer \\(0.4\\) over \\(0.5\\) as an estimate of \\(p\\). We call this function the likelihood function and denote it \\(L\\). That is \\[ L(p) := p^3(1-p)^7. \\] Figure 1.1: Likelihood of the sample In the picture we see that the likelihood function attains its highest value at \\(p=0.3\\). Using the above principle, we therefore prefer \\(0.3\\) as an estimate of \\(p\\) over any other value. This is the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of \\(p\\). Let us define the likelihood function in general. We have a parametric model of our observations, that is we assume that we observe random variables that are independent identically distributed, with a probability function (or density) \\(p_\\theta(x)\\). Here \\(\\theta\\) is an unknown parameter. For a random sample \\(x_1,\\ldots , x_n\\) of size \\(n\\) the likelihood function is \\[ L_n(\\theta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n p_\\theta(x_i). \\] That is, the likelihood is the probability (or density) of our observation, as a function of the unknown parameter. As a second example, say that we observe random variables \\(X_i\\) that are iid \\(\\mathsf N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\), where \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) are unknown parameters. In other words, the joint density of an iid sample is \\[ p(x_1,\\ldots, x_n) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}e^{-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}(x_i-\\mu)^2}. \\] The likelihood function is then \\[ L_n(\\mu,\\sigma^2) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}e^{-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}(x_i-\\mu)^2}. \\] That is, the density and the likelihood function are written using the same formulas, but the density is a function of \\(x_i\\), while the likelihood is a function of the unknown parameters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\). "],["1.2-maximum-likelihood-estimation.html", "1.2 Maximum likelihood estimation", " 1.2 Maximum likelihood estimation In this section we discuss how to find the maximum likelihood estimate. As in the previous section we consider an example: We will assume that time until something happens is exponentially distributed with parameter \\(\\lambda\\). Therefore the probability density of observing \\(T=t\\) is \\[ p_T(t) = \\lambda e^{-\\lambda t}. \\] On the other hand, we can also think of this as the likelihood function of the parameter \\(\\lambda\\), \\[ L(\\lambda) = \\lambda e^{-\\lambda t}. \\] If we have \\(n\\) independent observations, the joint density of these observations is the product of the marginal densities. Therefore the likelihood is also the product of the marginal likelihoods. That is, if we write \\(L_n(\\lambda)\\) for the likelihood of \\(n\\) observations, \\[ L_n(\\lambda) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\lambda e^{-\\lambda t_i}. \\] Many times it is easier to instead consider the logarithm of the likelihood, the log-likelihood, \\[ l_n(\\lambda):=\\ln L_n(\\lambda) = \\sum_{i=1}^n( \\ln \\lambda - \\lambda t_i ) = n\\ln\\lambda - \\lambda\\sum_{i=1}^n t_i= n(\\ln\\lambda - \\lambda \\bar t) , \\] where we as usual let \\(\\bar t = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n t_i\\). Let us say we observe a sample of size 100. Figure 1.2: Histogram of the sample We define a function in R that calculates the log-likelihood logLn &lt;- function(lambda, data){ n &lt;- length(data) tbar &lt;- mean(data) n*(log(lambda) - lambda*tbar) } Then we may calculate the log-likelihood of, for example, \\(\\lambda = 0.1\\), logLn(0.1, t) ## [1] -316.1482 Here the variable t is a vector that contains the observations. Let us plot the log-likelihood for a range of \\(\\lambda\\)-values. Figure 1.3: Log likelihood of the sample We can find the maximum likelihood estimate as the \\(\\lambda\\) that maximizes the likelihood (or log likelihood). That is: \\[ \\hat\\lambda = \\operatorname*{argmax}_\\lambda L_n(\\lambda) = \\operatorname*{argmax}_\\lambda l_n(\\lambda). \\] Since the likelihood is simple, we can find \\(\\hat \\lambda\\) directly: \\[ \\partial_\\lambda l_n(\\lambda)\\Big|_{\\lambda = \\hat\\lambda} = n\\left(\\frac{1}{\\hat \\lambda} - \\bar t\\right) = 0. \\] With solution \\(\\hat\\lambda =1/ \\bar t\\). For this sample: lambdaHat &lt;- 1/mean(t) lambdaHat ## [1] 0.1164284 We may also find the estimate using numerical optimization. optimResult &lt;- optimise( logLn, lower = 0.01, upper = 10.0, data = t, maximum = TRUE) optimResult$maximum ## [1] 0.1164178 "],["1.3-hypothesis-testing.html", "1.3 Hypothesis testing", " 1.3 Hypothesis testing In the previous section we saw how to estimate unknown parameters using maximum likelihood. While this is all well and good, we would like to also be able to test hypotheses regarding parameters. Consider Figure 1.4. Figure 1.4: Log likelihood of the sample There we have an estimate of \\(\\theta\\) which is \\(\\hat\\theta = 0.9\\). We would like to test \\(H_0: \\theta=\\theta_0 = 1\\) against \\(\\theta \\neq \\theta_0\\). This should be based on how far away, in some sense, the maximum likelihood estimate is from \\(\\theta_0\\). Looking at the figure, we can see three different ways of measuring how far away \\(\\hat\\theta\\) and \\(\\theta_0\\) are from each other. One way would be to measure the vertical distance between the log-likelihood function in \\(\\hat\\theta\\) and \\(\\theta_0\\). I.e.Â we would calculate: \\[ l(\\hat\\theta) - l(\\theta_0). \\] This is know as the likelihood ratio test. Another option is to calculate the horizontal distance between \\(\\hat\\theta\\) and \\(\\theta_0\\). I.e. to calculate the distance \\[ |\\hat\\theta - \\theta_0|. \\] This is known as the Wald test. Lastly we know that \\(\\partial_\\theta l(\\theta)|_{\\theta=\\hat\\theta} = 0\\). So we could calculate \\[ |\\partial_\\theta l(\\theta)|_{\\theta=\\theta_0}|, \\] and see how close it is to 0. This is known as the Score test. In the following sections we examine each test in detail. "],["1.4-likelihood-ratio-test.html", "1.4 Likelihood ratio test", " 1.4 Likelihood ratio test We are interested in testing the following hypotheses \\[ H_0:\\theta \\in \\Theta_0\\text{ vs. } H_1:\\theta \\in \\Theta_0^\\complement. \\] Here \\(\\Theta_0\\) is some set of parameter values. It could for example be that \\(\\Theta_0 = (-\\infty,\\theta_0)\\) or simply \\(\\Theta_0 = \\theta_0\\). We define the likelihood ratio as \\[ \\lambda_{\\text{LR}} := 2(l(\\hat\\theta) - l(\\hat\\theta_0)), \\] where \\[ l(\\hat\\theta_0) = \\sup_{\\theta\\in\\Theta_0}l(\\theta) \\] and \\[ l(\\hat\\theta) = \\sup_{\\theta\\in\\Theta}l(\\theta). \\] Since \\(l(\\hat\\theta)\\geq l(\\hat\\theta_0)\\), we have that \\(\\lambda_{\\text{LR}} \\geq 0\\) and data agrees well with \\(H_0\\) if \\(\\lambda_{\\text{LR}}\\) is small. Therefore the rejection region will be of the form \\(\\lambda_{\\text{LR}} &gt; k\\), where \\(k\\) is determined to get the correct size of the test. We can not say more in general, the continuation depends on the particular problem and tends to become complicated for anything but simple models. As before let us say that we have an iid sample from an exponential distribution and wish to test \\(H_0:~\\lambda = \\lambda_0\\) against \\(H_1:~\\lambda \\neq \\lambda_0\\), with \\(\\lambda_0=0.1\\). We have already seen that \\[ l(\\lambda) = n(\\ln \\lambda - \\lambda \\bar t) \\] and that \\(\\hat\\lambda = 1/\\bar t\\). Therefore \\[ l(\\lambda) = n \\left( \\ln\\lambda - \\frac{\\lambda}{\\hat\\lambda} \\right). \\] Now, we can write \\(l(\\hat\\lambda) = n\\left(\\ln\\hat\\lambda - 1\\right)\\). The likelihood ratio is then: \\[ \\lambda_{\\text{LR}} = 2(l(\\hat\\lambda) - l(\\lambda_0)) = 2n\\left( \\ln\\hat\\lambda - 1 - \\ln \\lambda_0 + \\frac{\\lambda_0}{\\hat\\lambda} \\right) = 2n\\left(\\ln \\frac{\\hat\\lambda}{\\lambda_0} + \\frac{\\lambda_0-\\hat\\lambda}{\\hat\\lambda}\\right). \\] Recall that we should reject \\(H_0\\) if \\(\\lambda_{\\text{LR}}&gt;k\\), and that \\(k\\) is set to get the correct size. But to do this we need to know the distribution of \\(\\lambda_{\\text{LR}}\\) and looking at the formula above, this seems difficult. Instead we search for something which is equivalent to \\(\\lambda_{\\text{LR}}&gt;k\\), but with a known distribution. Towards this we plot \\(\\lambda_{LR}(\\hat\\lambda)\\): Figure 1.5: Illustration of the likelihood ratio We see that \\(\\lambda_{LR}\\) is decreasing for \\(\\hat\\lambda &lt; \\lambda_0\\) and increasing for \\(\\hat\\lambda &gt; \\lambda_0\\) with minimum at \\(\\hat\\lambda = \\lambda_0\\). Therefore \\(\\lambda_{LR}&gt;k\\) is equivalent to \\(\\hat\\lambda &lt; k_L\\) or \\(\\hat\\lambda &gt; k_U\\), for some choices of \\(k_L\\) and \\(k_U\\). These should be determined so that the test gets the correct size. The size of the test is \\[\\begin{align} &amp;1- P_{\\lambda_0} \\left(k_L&lt; \\hat\\lambda &lt; k_U \\right) = 1- P_{\\lambda_0} \\left(k_L&lt; \\frac{1}{\\bar t} &lt; k_U \\right) = 1- P_{\\lambda_0} \\left(1/k_U&lt; \\bar t &lt; 1/k_L \\right)\\\\ =&amp; 1- P_{\\lambda_0} \\left(\\tilde k_L&lt; \\sum_{i=1}^n T_i&lt; \\tilde k_U \\right), \\end{align}\\] with \\(\\tilde k_L := n/k_U\\) and similarly for \\(\\tilde k_U\\). This probability can be calculated since we know that \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n T_i \\sim \\Gamma(n,\\lambda)\\). If we let \\(\\Gamma_{\\alpha}(n,\\lambda)\\) be the \\(\\alpha\\)-quantile of the gamma distribution, i.e.Â the number such that \\[ \\alpha = P\\left( \\Gamma(n,\\lambda )&gt; \\Gamma_\\alpha(n,\\lambda) \\right), \\] we see that the rejection region for a size \\(\\alpha\\) test is \\[ \\left\\{ T_i\\mid \\sum_{i=1}^n T_i &gt; \\Gamma_{\\alpha/2}(n,\\lambda_0) \\text{ or } \\sum_{i=1}^n T_i &lt; \\Gamma_{1-\\alpha/2}(n,\\lambda_0) \\right\\}. \\] or equivalently \\[ \\left\\{ \\hat \\lambda \\mid \\hat\\lambda &lt; \\frac{n}{\\Gamma_{\\alpha/2}(n,\\lambda_0)} \\text{ or } \\hat\\lambda &gt; \\frac{n}{\\Gamma_{1-\\alpha/2}(n,\\lambda_0)} \\right\\}. \\] Let us implement this: alpha &lt;- 0.05 lambda0 &lt;- 0.1 n &lt;- 100 upperCriticalValue &lt;- n / qgamma(alpha/2, shape = n, rate = lambda0) lowerCriticalValue &lt;- n / qgamma(1-alpha/2, shape = n, rate = lambda0) upperCriticalValue ## [1] 0.1229045 lowerCriticalValue ## [1] 0.08296762 In this case we had \\(\\hat\\lambda =\\) 0.1164 and so we would not reject \\(\\lambda \\neq 0.1\\). Another option is to calculate the p-value. Recall that the p-value is the smallest level for which \\(H_0\\) is rejected. That is, it is the \\(\\alpha\\) that solves \\(\\Gamma_{1-\\alpha/2}(n,\\lambda_0) = n/\\hat\\lambda\\). But, by definition \\[ \\alpha = 2 P \\left( \\Gamma(n,\\lambda_0) &lt; \\Gamma_{1-\\alpha/2}) \\right) \\] and therefore the p-value is \\[ 2P\\left( \\Gamma(n,\\lambda_0) &lt; \\frac{n}{\\hat\\lambda} \\right). \\] 2* pgamma(n/lambdaHat, shape = n, rate = lambda0) ## [1] 0.1471398 Again we see that we would not reject \\(H_0\\) on the 5%-level.

This will be useful when we search for the asymptotic distribution of the MLE. We would like to approximate a function \\(f(x)\\) by a polynomial \\(p(x)\\) of degree \\(n\\), around a point \\(x_0\\). That is, if \\(x\\approx x_0\\) we would like \\(f(x)\\approx p(x)\\). How should we choose \\(p(x)\\)?

For the \\(k\\)th derivative, \\[ f^{(k)}(x_0) = p^{(k)}(x_0) = 2\\cdot 3\\cdots kc_k = k!c_k, \\] so that \\(c_k = f^{(k)}(x_0)/k!\\). To summarize, the order \\(n\\) polynomial approximation of \\(f(x)\\) close to \\(x_0\\) is \\[ f(x) \\approx f(x_0) + f&#39;(x_0)(x-x_0) + \\frac{f&#39;&#39;(x_0)}{2!}(x-x_0)^2 + \\cdots \\frac{f^{(n)}(x_0)}{n!}(x-x_0)^n. \\] This is known as a Taylor series. In fact, we can do even better by giving a formula for the error. Taylorâs theorem says that If \\(p(x)\\) is the order \\(n\\) polynomial approximation of \\(f(x)\\) as given above, then the approximation error is \\[ f(x) -p(x) = \\frac{f^{(n+1)}(\\xi)}{(n+1)!}(x-x_0)^{n+1}, \\] where \\(\\xi\\) is some number between \\(x\\) and \\(x_0\\).

But first let us recall some properties of the normal distribution, that will be used repeatedly in this chapter. If \\(X\\sim \\mathsf N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\) then \\(a+bX\\) also has a normal distribution and \\[\\begin{align*} E[a+bX] &amp;= a+bE[X] = a+b\\mu,\\\\ \\operatorname{Var}(a+bX) &amp;= b^2\\operatorname{Var}(X) = b^2\\sigma^2. \\end{align*}\\] That is \\(a+bX\\sim \\mathsf N(a+b\\mu,b^2\\sigma^2)\\). In particular, \\[ \\frac{X-\\mu}{\\sigma} \\sim \\mathsf N(0,1). \\] Now let us turn to the maximum likelhood estimators. To start, we imagine that we observe a random variable \\(X\\), from a parameterized distribution with density \\(p_\\theta\\). Our discussion will also be valid if we have a discrete random variable with a probability function \\(p_\\theta\\). Then we have a log-likelihood \\(l_x(\\theta):=\\ln p_\\theta(x)\\). Here we will calculate the expected value and variance of the random variable \\(l_X&#39;(\\theta):=\\partial_\\theta \\ln p_\\theta(X)\\).

This calculation was for a sample \\(X\\) of size 1. If we have an independent sample of size \\(n\\), we define the log-likelihood as \\[ l_n(\\theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^n l_{X_i}(\\theta). \\] Then we can also calculate \\[\\begin{align*} E[l&#39;_n(\\theta)] &amp;= E[\\partial_\\theta \\sum_{i=1}^n l_{X_i}(\\theta)] =\\sum_{i=1}^n E[\\partial_\\theta l_{X_i}(\\theta)] = 0,\\\\ Var(l&#39;_n(\\theta)) &amp;= Var(\\partial_\\theta \\sum_{i=1}^n l_{X_i}(\\theta)) = \\sum_{i=1}^n Var(l_{X_i}&#39;(\\theta)) = n I(\\theta) =:I_n(\\theta). \\end{align*}\\] Let us now recall the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. They state that if \\(X_1,\\ldots X_n\\) are iid random variables with mean \\(\\mu\\) and finite variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), then for large \\(n\\) \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i&amp; \\overset{asym.}{\\sim} \\mu,\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\Big(\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i-\\mu\\Big)&amp; \\overset{asym.}{\\sim} \\mathsf N(0,\\sigma^2). \\end{align*}\\] These asymptotic results in practice mean that we approximate the distribution of the left side with the right side if \\(n\\) is large.

One problem with the above is however that \\(I(\\theta)\\) is often difficult to calculate. However \\(-l&#39;&#39;_n(\\theta)/n=:\\hat I(\\theta)\\) is a consistent estimator of \\(I(\\theta)\\). Then we may also write: \\[ \\sqrt{n \\hat I(\\theta)}(\\hat\\theta_n - \\theta) \\overset{asym.}{\\sim} \\mathsf N(0,1). \\] A further problem is that \\(\\theta\\) is in general unknown.

We can rewrite this as \\[ \\hat \\theta_n \\overset{asym.}{\\sim} \\mathsf N\\left(\\theta, \\frac{1}{n \\hat I(\\hat\\theta_n)}\\right). \\] Now let us apply this to the example of the exponential distribution.

If this is not the case we can instead do a second order Taylor expansion \\[ f(\\hat\\theta_n) \\approx f(\\theta) + f&#39;(\\theta)(\\hat\\theta_n - \\theta) + \\frac{f&#39;&#39;(\\theta)}{2}(\\hat\\theta_n - \\theta)^2 = f(\\theta) + \\frac{f&#39;&#39;(\\theta)}{2}(\\hat\\theta_n - \\theta)^2. \\] Rearranging gives, \\[ n(f(\\hat\\theta_n) - f(\\theta)) \\approx \\frac{f&#39;&#39;(\\theta)}{2}(\\sqrt{n}(\\hat\\theta_n-\\theta))^2. \\] We assumed that \\(\\sqrt{n} (\\hat\\theta_n - \\theta) \\overset{asym.}{\\sim} N(0,\\sigma^2)\\). The continuous mapping theorem (not covered here) states that if \\(f\\) is a continuous function and if \\(X_n \\overset{asym.}{\\sim} X\\), then \\(f(X_n) \\overset{asym.}{\\sim} f(X)\\). Therefore, if we let \\(Z\\sim N(0,1),\\) we can write our assumption as \\(\\sqrt{n} (\\hat\\theta_n - \\theta) \\overset{asym.}{\\sim} \\sigma Z\\) and thus, recalling that the square of a standard normal random variable has a \\(\\chi^2_1\\)-distribution, \\[ (\\sqrt{n}(\\hat\\theta_n-\\theta))^2 \\overset{asym.}{\\sim} \\sigma^2Z^2 \\overset{d}{=} \\sigma^2 \\chi^2_1. \\] With that we get the second order Delta method: \\[ n(f(\\hat\\theta_n) - f(\\theta)) \\overset{asym.}{\\sim} \\frac{f&#39;&#39;(\\theta)}{2}\\sigma^2\\chi_1^2. \\] Now let us apply the delta method to the exponential distribution. We would like to estimate the probability that the time until the next event is larger than 10. That is the probability \\[ p = P(T&gt;10) = e^{-10\\lambda}. \\] The MLE follows from the invariance principle of maximum likelihood, i.e.Â \\(\\hat p = e^{-10\\hat\\lambda}\\). The distribution of \\(\\hat p\\) can be found by the delta method if we let \\(p=f(\\lambda) = e^{-10\\lambda}\\). Then \\(f&#39;(\\lambda) = -10e^{-10\\lambda} = -10p\\). In this case \\(f&#39;(\\lambda)\\neq 0\\), so we may apply the first order delta method. Recall from the previous section that \\[ \\sqrt n\\left( \\hat\\lambda_n - \\lambda \\right) \\overset{asym.}{\\sim} \\mathsf N(0, \\lambda^2), \\] that is, the \\(\\sigma^2\\) appearing in the delta method is \\(\\lambda^2\\). Now, applying the delta method gives \\[ \\sqrt n(\\hat p_n- p) \\overset{asym.}{\\sim} \\mathsf N(0,100p^2\\lambda^2). \\] As usual, we may replace unknown parameters with a consistent estimate, i.e.Â \\(p\\) with \\(\\hat p\\) and \\(\\lambda\\) with \\(\\hat\\lambda\\). Therefore, \\[ \\sqrt n(\\hat p_n- p) \\overset{asym.}{\\sim} \\mathsf N(0,100\\hat p^2\\hat\\lambda^2) = \\mathsf N(0,0.132), \\] or \\[ \\hat p_n \\overset{asym.}{\\sim} \\mathsf N(p,0.132/n). \\] "],["1.8-wilks-test.html", "1.8 Wilksâ test", " 1.8 Wilksâ test In the previous sections we found the asymptotic distribution of \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\). Here we seek the asymptotic distribution of the likelihood ratio \\(-2(l_n(\\theta_0) - l_n(\\hat\\theta_n)))\\). The reason is that, as we have seen, finding the exact distribution is difficult. If we have the approximate, asymptotic, distribution, we can use that to do for example hypothesis testing. For ease of notation we suppress the \\(n\\) and write \\(l\\) and \\(\\hat\\theta\\).

This is not true in general. "],["1.11-confidence-intervals.html", "1.11 Confidence intervals", " 1.11 Confidence intervals We have derived a number of different tests. In principle all of them can be turned into confidence intervals since there is a correspondence between hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. Let us first examine how we can use the Wald test to construct confidence intervals. The Wald test is based on that for large \\(n\\): \\[ \\frac{\\hat\\theta- \\theta}{\\textrm{Sd}(\\hat\\theta)} \\overset{asym.}{\\sim} \\mathsf{N}(0,1), \\] Therefore we can write \\[ 1-\\alpha = P\\left( -z_{\\alpha/2} &lt; \\frac{\\hat\\theta- \\theta}{\\textrm{Sd}(\\hat\\theta)} \\leq z_{\\alpha/2} \\right) = P\\left( \\hat\\theta -\\textrm{Sd}(\\hat\\theta) z_{\\alpha/2}\\leq \\theta \\leq \\hat\\theta + \\textrm{Sd}(\\hat\\theta) z_{\\alpha/2}\\right). \\] Which means that \\(\\left[\\hat\\theta -\\textrm{Sd}(\\hat\\theta) z_{\\alpha/2}, \\hat\\theta +\\textrm{Sd}(\\hat\\theta) z_{\\alpha/2}\\right]\\) is a \\(1-\\alpha\\) confidence interval for \\(\\theta\\). Let us derive the same CI in a slightly different way. In the Wald test we would accept \\(H_0: \\theta=\\theta_0\\) if \\(\\left| \\hat\\theta - \\theta_0 \\right|/Sd(\\hat\\theta)&lt;z_{\\alpha/2}\\). Solving this for \\(\\theta_0\\) gives \\[ \\hat\\theta -\\textrm{Sd}(\\hat\\theta) z_{\\alpha/2}\\leq \\theta_0 \\leq \\hat\\theta + \\textrm{Sd}(\\hat\\theta) z_{\\alpha/2}. \\] If we replace \\(\\theta_0\\) with \\(\\theta\\) we obtain the CI above. Therefore we may think of the CI as being the set of \\(\\theta_0\\) that we would accept in a hypothesis test. The same principle can be applied to convert any hypothesis test to a corresponding CI. For example the score test accepts \\(H_0\\) if \\[ \\frac{\\left| l&#39;_n(\\theta_0)\\right |}{\\sqrt{I_n(\\theta_0)}}&lt; z_{\\alpha/2}, \\] and so solving this for \\(\\theta_0\\) gives a CI. However, in most cases it is not possible to obtain a closed form solution and we have solve it numerically. Let us as an example do it for the exponential distribution: \\[\\begin{align} l&#39;_n(\\lambda) &amp;= n\\left( \\frac{1}{\\lambda} - \\frac{1}{\\hat\\lambda} \\right),\\\\ I_n(\\lambda) &amp;= - l&#39;&#39;_n(\\lambda) = \\frac{n}{\\lambda^2}. \\end{align}\\] We plot the score statistic as a function of \\(\\lambda\\): Figure 1.7: Score statistic and confidence intervall To find the CI we need to solve \\[ \\frac{\\left| l&#39;_n(\\lambda)\\right |}{\\sqrt{I_n(\\lambda)}} = z_{\\alpha/2}, \\] in terms of \\(\\lambda\\).

First, recall that the following is equivalent \\[\\begin{align} X &amp; \\sim \\mathsf N(\\mu,\\sigma^2),\\\\ \\frac{X-\\mu}{\\sigma} &amp; \\sim \\mathsf N(0,1). \\end{align}\\] Also recall from the B-course that for a large sample \\[ \\bar X \\sim \\mathsf N(\\mu,\\sigma^2/n). \\] The variance is like this because of \\[ Var(\\bar X) = Var\\left( \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i \\right) = \\frac{1}{n^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n Var(X_i) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}. \\] If we use the above, we get that \\[ \\frac{\\bar X-\\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} \\sim \\mathsf N(0,1). \\] This we used to construct what we called the large sample test. That is, we should accept \\(\\mu=\\mu_0\\) as opposed to \\(\\mu\\neq \\mu_0\\) if \\[ \\frac{|\\bar X-\\mu_0|}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}&lt;z_{\\alpha/2}. \\] In this chapter we have seen that this is true in more generallity, whenever we have an MLE. That is \\[ \\hat\\theta \\overset{asym.}{\\sim} \\mathsf N(\\theta,\\sigma^2_{\\hat\\theta}), \\] the same as \\[ \\frac{\\hat\\theta - \\theta}{\\sigma_{\\hat\\theta}} \\overset{asym.}{\\sim} \\mathsf N(0,1). \\] So we can again use this for hypothesis testing or CI, the only remaining challenge is finding \\(\\sigma_{\\hat\\theta}\\). We have a couple of different tools to do this. Let us consider yet another example. We have a sample of size \\(n\\) from \\(\\mathsf{Be}(p)\\). We could also say that we have a sample of size 1 from \\(\\mathsf{Bin}(n,p)\\), the analysis will be the same. But let us stick with \\(\\mathsf{Be}(p)\\). We want to do inference on \\(p\\). The MLE of \\(p\\) is \\(\\hat p = \\bar x\\) and we know that \\[ \\hat p \\overset{asym.}{\\sim} \\mathsf N(p,\\sigma^2_{\\hat p}). \\] Here we can find \\(\\sigma^2_{\\hat p}\\) by direct calculation. \\[ \\sigma^2_{\\hat p} = Var(\\hat p) = Var(\\bar X) = \\frac{1}{n}Var(X_i) = \\frac{p(1-p)}{n}. \\] Therefore, \\[ \\hat p \\overset{asym.}{\\sim} \\mathsf N\\left(p,\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}\\right). \\] If we write this on the form of a test statistic, \\[ \\frac{\\hat p - p}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}}\\overset{asym.}{\\sim} \\mathsf N\\left(0,1\\right). \\] The problem is that the denominator contains the unkown \\(p\\). Since \\(\\hat p\\) is the MLE, it is consistent, and we may therefore also say that, \\[ \\hat p \\overset{asym.}{\\sim} \\mathsf N\\left(p,\\frac{\\hat p(1-\\hat p)}{n}\\right). \\] Or, \\[ \\frac{\\hat p - p}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat p(1-\\hat p)}{n}}} \\overset{asym.}{\\sim} \\mathsf N\\left(0,1\\right), \\] which can be used for constructing the Wald test. What this then means is that, if \\(n\\) is large, and we where to estimate \\(p\\) with \\(\\hat p\\) for many different samples, the distribution of the estimates would be approximately distributed as \\(\\mathsf N(0,1)\\). Let us verify this with a simulation. set.seed(42) n &lt;- 100 p0 &lt;- 0.5 replications &lt;- 1000 p.hats &lt;- array(dim = replications) for (i in seq_len(replications)) { x &lt;- sample(c(0,1), size = n, replace = TRUE) p.hats[i] &lt;- mean(x) } wald &lt;- (p.hats - p0)/sqrt(p.hats*(1-p.hats)/n) Figure 1.12: Simulated density of the Wald statistic and the standard normal density In this case we were lucky that we could calculate \\(Var(\\hat p)\\) directly. Another path is to use the Fisher information. We found that \\[ \\hat \\theta \\overset{asym.}{\\sim} \\mathsf N\\left(\\theta, \\frac{1}{nI(\\theta)}\\right). \\] The Fisher information is \\[ I(\\theta) = -E[l&#39;&#39;(\\theta)]. \\] Note that here \\(I(\\theta)\\) is the Fisher information of a sample of size 1, and so also \\(l(\\theta)\\) is the log-likelihood of a sample of size 1. Here, \\[\\begin{align} L(p) &amp;= p^{x}(1-p)^{1-x},~0\\leq p \\leq 1,\\\\ l(p) &amp;= x\\ln p + (1-x)\\ln (1-p),\\\\ l&#39;(p) &amp;= \\frac{x}{p} - \\frac{1-x}{1-p},\\\\ l&#39;&#39;(p) &amp;= -\\frac{x}{p^2} -\\frac{1-x}{(1-p)^2},\\\\ I(p) &amp;= -E[l&#39;&#39;(p)] = E\\left[ \\frac{X}{p^2} + \\frac{1-X}{(1-p)^2} \\right]\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{p}{p^2} + \\frac{1-p}{(1-p)^2} = \\frac{1}{p(1-p)}. \\end{align}\\] So that we recover the same variance as above. Another option is to use a Score test. The score statistic is \\[ \\frac{l_n&#39;(\\theta_0)}{\\sqrt{I_n(\\theta_0)}}. \\] Here \\(l_n(\\theta_0)\\) is the log-likelihood of the sample of size \\(n\\). In our case \\[ l_n&#39;(p) = \\sum_{i=1}^n l_i&#39;(p) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\frac{x_i}{p} - \\frac{1-x_i}{1-p} \\right) = \\frac{n\\bar x}{p} - \\frac{n-\\bar x}{1-p} = \\frac{n(\\bar x -p)}{p(1-p)} = \\frac{n(\\hat p -p)}{p(1-p)}. \\] Also, \\(I_n(\\theta) = nI(\\theta)\\) is the Fisher information of the sample of size \\(n\\). For us \\[ I_n(p) = \\frac{n}{p(1-p)}. \\] The score statistic is then \\[ \\frac{l_n&#39;(p_0)}{\\sqrt{I_n(p_0)}} = \\frac{n(\\hat p -p_0)}{p_0(1-p_0)}\\sqrt{\\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}} = \\frac{\\hat p -p_0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}}, \\] which is asymptotically distributed as \\(\\mathsf N(0,1)\\) if \\(p=p_0\\). This is similar to the Wald statistic. The difference is that \\(\\hat p\\) in the denominator is replaced by \\(p_0\\). The final test is the asymptotic likelihood ratio test. It states that, if \\(p=p_0\\), \\[ 2(l_n(\\hat p)-l_n(p_0)) \\overset{asym.}{\\sim} \\chi^2_1. \\] This is perhaps the easiest test to perform, since it is only a matter of evaluating the log-likelihood and comparing the the appropriate quantile of \\(\\chi^2_1\\).
